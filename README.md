### Enable Debug with VS Code
Folks, if you want to enable debugging with VSCode then you need to create `launch.json` file and add below two tasks in that file.

```
{
   "type":"node",
   "request":"launch",
   "name":"Debug",
   "program":"${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-dev-server",
   "args":[
      "--progress",
      "--debug"
   ]
},
{
   "name":"Launch Chrome against localhost, with sourcemaps",
   "type":"chrome",
   "request":"launch",
   "url":"http://localhost:3000",
   "sourceMaps":true,
   "webRoot":"${workspaceRoot}"
}
```

After adding these tasks, you need to run first debug task and then launch chrome task.
